##DS18B20+ One Wire Digital Temperature Sensor and the Raspberry Pi

###introduction

Not another blog with a Pi and temperature sensor you say. But wait, this is different. This includes the power of Eon, the power to view the temperature readings in a beautiful graph that updates itself in real time. From anywhere in the world, with just a few lines of code. Real time dashboards, its happening! Who doesnt love a great visualization notifying you to switch on the air conditioning, when to WHAT ARE THE APPLICATIONS WITH EON? 

You are probably thinking what this magical Eon is, and how to get your hands on it. Eon is an open-source chart for realtime data. In this blog, I will explain how to use it to view real time temperature readings.  Lets not waste any more words shall we?

### what this sensor does?


### circuit diagram

### understanding the script to run the temperature sensor

### What is Eon, ease of use
copy paste code
visualization easier than seeing a bunch of text
irrespective of the device or platform you are working on, just need a browser


### pubnub publishes to world with eon
all you have to do is include the eon script, works with the mobile web as well. 

### how does eon work to chart the real time graph
Explain the basic concepts of eon - the publish and subscribe

### applicatio




THIS IS EON.
